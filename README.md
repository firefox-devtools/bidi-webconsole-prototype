# BiDi WebConsole Prototype

A simple webconsole UI relying on WebDriver BiDi events and commands.\
A user can connect the webconsole to a Firefox instance, see the console events and execute the javascript, similar to a browser console.

[Demo](https://firefox-dev.tools/bidi-webconsole-prototype/)\
After running the UI, follow the instructions on the screen on how to run a Firefox instance and click `Connect`.

## How to develop

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

The project is automatically built and deployed to Github pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.\
See the Demo above.
